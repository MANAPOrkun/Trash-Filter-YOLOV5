# Trash-Filter-YOLOV5

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?

- In this project called Recycle is Fun, I aim to raise people's awareness and encourage them to recycle so that the oceans, seas, or the environment do not become more polluted and damaged in our increasingly polluted world. Recycle is Fun is aimed to detect recyclable objects such as cardboard, paper, plastic, and metal with the help of artificial intelligence and to facilitate recycling.
